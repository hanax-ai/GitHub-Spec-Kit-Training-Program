2. **Architecture Documentation** → `docs/architecture/`
3. **Best Practices & Runbooks** → `docs/operations/`
4. **Configuration Templates** → `templates/`
5. **Key Decision Records** → `docs/adrs/`

**🎯 Practical Exercise:**
Create specifications for each content category:
```bash
cd HX-Infrastructure-Knowledge-Base

# Create content integration specifications
uvx --from git+https://github.com/github/spec-kit.git specify init sprint_documentation --ai copilot
uvx --from git+https://github.com/github/spec-kit.git specify init architecture_docs --ai copilot

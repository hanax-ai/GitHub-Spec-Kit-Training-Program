## ðŸŒ… Morning Session (3-4 hours)

### Hour 1: Environment Validation & Setup

#### 1.1 Complete Environment Validation (30 minutes)
```bash
# Run comprehensive validation
cd /home/ubuntu/github_spec_training
./validate_environment.sh

# If any failures, address immediately
./validate_environment.sh --install-help
```

uvx --from git+https://github.com/github/spec-kit.git specify init test_foundation_project

# Verify installation success
cd test_foundation_project
ls -la
cat README.md
```

**Expected Outputs:**

- Configuration files present (.specify/, prompts/, etc.)
- AI agent integration working
- Slash commands accessible in your AI agent

### Hour 2: Spec-Driven Development Fundamentals

#### 2.1 Understanding the SDD Philosophy (45 minutes)

**Core Concepts to Master:**
1. **Intent-First Development:** Specifications capture "what" and "why" before "how"
2. **AI-Assisted Implementation:** Leverage AI agents for code generation from clear specs
3. **Iterative Refinement:** Specifications evolve through feedback loops
4. **Quality Through Clarity:** Better specs = better code = fewer bugs

**Practical Exercise:**
```bash
# Create your first specification
uvx --from git+https://github.com/github/spec-kit.git specify init day1_learning_project --ai copilot

cd day1_learning_project
```

In your AI agent, use the `/specify` command to create a specification for:
**Project:** "Personal Task Management System for HX-Infrastructure Projects"

**Specification Requirements:**
- User can create, edit, and delete tasks
- Tasks have priority levels and due dates
- Integration with HX-Infrastructure project categories
- Simple web interface for task management

#### 2.2 The Four Phases Deep Dive (30 minutes)

**Phase 1: Specify**
- Define user journeys and success criteria
- Focus on business value and user experience
- Avoid technical implementation details
- Create clear acceptance criteria

**Phase 2: Plan**
- Technical architecture and technology choices
- Integration with existing systems (HX-Infrastructure)
- Security and compliance considerations
- Resource and timeline estimates

**Phase 3: Tasks**
- Break down into atomic, testable units
- Define clear completion criteria
- Sequence dependencies properly
- Enable parallel development where possible

**Phase 4: Implement**
- Execute tasks using AI assistance
- Validate against specifications continuously
- Refactor and optimize iteratively
- Document decisions and learnings

### Hour 3: First Hands-On Project

#### 3.1 Complete Specify Phase (45 minutes)

Using your AI agent with the `/specify` command, create a comprehensive specification for the Personal Task Management System. Your specification should include:

**User Stories:**
- As an HX-Infrastructure team member, I want to track project tasks
- As a project manager, I want to see task priorities and deadlines
- As a developer, I want to categorize tasks by project area

**Success Criteria:**
- System handles 100+ tasks without performance issues
- Interface is intuitive for non-technical users
- Data persists between sessions
- Mobile-responsive design

**Acceptance Tests:**
- User can create a task in under 30 seconds
- Task filtering works across all categories
- Due date notifications are accurate
- Data export functionality works

#### 3.2 Validation Checkpoint (15 minutes)

**Self-Assessment Questions:**
1. Does your specification clearly define the "what" without the "how"?
2. Can someone else understand the requirements without technical knowledge?
3. Are success criteria measurable and testable?
4. Does the specification align with HX-Infrastructure needs?

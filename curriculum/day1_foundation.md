ls -la
cat README.md
```

### Hour 2: Spec-Driven Development Fundamentals

#### 2.1 Understanding the SDD Philosophy (45 minutes)

**Core Concepts to Master:**
1. **Intent-First Development:** Specifications capture "what" and "why" before "how"
2. **AI-Assisted Implementation:** Leverage AI agents for code generation from clear specs
3. **Iterative Refinement:** Specifications evolve through feedback loops
4. **Quality Through Clarity:** Better specs = better code = fewer bugs

**ðŸŽ¯ HX-Infrastructure Practical Exercise:**
```bash
# Clone and analyze the HX-Infrastructure Knowledge Base
cd /home/ubuntu/github_spec_training
git clone https://github.com/hanax-ai/HX-Infrastructure-Knowledge-Base.git
cd HX-Infrastructure-Knowledge-Base

# Create your first specification for knowledge base enhancement
uvx --from git+https://github.com/github/spec-kit.git specify init hx_kb_enhancement --ai copilot
```

In your AI agent, use the `/specify` command to create a specification for:
**Project:** "HX-Infrastructure Knowledge Base Content Integration"

**Specification Requirements:**
- Analyze current knowledge base structure and content gaps
- Create systematic approach for integrating archived project learnings
- Establish documentation standards and templates
- Design validation workflows for content quality
- Plan progressive content population across training days

#### 2.2 The Four Phases Deep Dive (30 minutes)

**Phase 1: Specify**
- Define clear, actionable requirements
- Establish success criteria and constraints
- Document assumptions and dependencies

**Phase 2: Plan**
- Break down specifications into implementable tasks
- Sequence work for optimal flow
- Identify potential risks and mitigation strategies

**Phase 3: Implement**
- Execute planned tasks with AI assistance
- Maintain quality through continuous validation
- Document decisions and learnings

**Phase 4: Validate**
- Test implementations against specifications
- Gather feedback and iterate
- Prepare for next development cycle

**ðŸŽ¯ HX-KB Application:**
Apply these phases to analyze the current HX-Infrastructure Knowledge Base:
1. **Specify:** Document what content needs to be integrated
2. **Plan:** Create integration roadmap for training week
3. **Implement:** Begin with directory structure and templates
4. **Validate:** Ensure structure aligns with integration plan

### Hour 3: First Real Project Implementation

#### 3.1 HX-Infrastructure Knowledge Base Analysis (45 minutes)

**Current State Assessment:**
```bash
cd HX-Infrastructure-Knowledge-Base

# Analyze current structure
find . -type f -name "*.md" | head -20
cat README.md | head -50

# Review existing workflow
cat .github/workflows/connectivity-check.yml
```

**Analysis Tasks:**
1. **Repository Structure Review:**
   - Document current directory layout
   - Identify placeholder sections that need content
   - Note existing documentation patterns

2. **Content Gap Analysis:**
   - List sections marked as placeholders
   - Identify missing documentation categories
   - Assess integration opportunities

3. **Workflow Assessment:**
   - Review existing GitHub Actions workflow
   - Identify enhancement opportunities
   - Plan additional validation workflows

**ðŸŽ¯ Deliverable:** Create `docs/analysis/day1-assessment.md` documenting findings

#### 3.2 Initial Knowledge Base Enhancement (30 minutes)

**Create Foundation Structure:**
```bash
# Create initial directory structure for integration
mkdir -p docs/analysis
mkdir -p docs/integration
mkdir -p exercises/hx-kb
mkdir -p metrics/training

# Create first ADR for integration approach
mkdir -p docs/adrs
```

**First ADR Creation:**
Create `docs/adrs/ADR-0001-training-integration.md` with:
- **Status:** Proposed
- **Context:** Integration of HX-KB into training program
- **Decision:** Use progressive content development approach
- **Consequences:** Enhanced practical learning, real project outcomes

#### 3.3 Specification Refinement (15 minutes)

**Refine Your Specification:**
Based on analysis, update your specification to include:
- Specific content integration priorities
- Training day milestone mapping
- Quality validation criteria
- Success measurement approaches

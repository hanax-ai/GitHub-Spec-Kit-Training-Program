# Specification-Driven Development Guide

## Overview
Specification-Driven Development (SDD) is a methodology that emphasizes creating detailed specifications before implementation.

## Key Principles
1. **Specification First**: Always define what you're building before building it
2. **Clear Requirements**: Document functional and non-functional requirements
3. **Iterative Refinement**: Specifications evolve with understanding
4. **Validation**: Continuously validate implementation against specification

## Process Steps
1. **Define**: Create initial specification
2. **Review**: Stakeholder review and feedback
3. **Refine**: Update specification based on feedback
4. **Implement**: Build according to specification
5. **Validate**: Ensure implementation matches specification

## Best Practices
- Use clear, unambiguous language
- Include examples and use cases
- Define acceptance criteria
- Version control specifications
- Regular specification reviews

## Tools and Templates
- ADR (Architecture Decision Records)
- User story templates
- API specifications
- Test specifications

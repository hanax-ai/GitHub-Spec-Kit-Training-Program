# Defect Management Workflow

This document outlines the comprehensive defect management workflow for the GitHub Spec Kit Training Program.

## Overview

Our defect management system ensures systematic tracking, resolution, and prevention of issues throughout the training program lifecycle.

## Defect Categories

### 1. Training Content Issues
- Curriculum errors or outdated information
- Exercise instructions that are unclear or incorrect
- Missing or broken links in training materials
- Template formatting or content issues

### 2. Technical Issues
- Script execution failures
- Environment setup problems
- Testing framework issues
- Integration failures

### 3. Documentation Issues
- Incomplete or inaccurate documentation
- Missing prerequisites or setup instructions
- Broken internal or external links
- Formatting inconsistencies

## Defect Lifecycle

### 1. Detection
- **Automated Detection**: Scripts and tests identify issues
- **Manual Detection**: Users report issues via GitHub issues
- **Review Detection**: Code review process identifies potential problems

### 2. Logging
- All defects are logged in [DEFECT_LOG.md](DEFECT_LOG.md)
- Each defect receives a unique identifier using format: **DEF-YYYY-####** (e.g., DEF-2025-0001)
- Severity and priority are assigned using standardized GitHub labels
- Initial assessment and categorization

### 3. Assignment
- Defects are assigned based on category and expertise
- Training content issues → Content team
- Technical issues → Development team
- Documentation issues → Documentation team

### 4. Resolution
- Root cause analysis performed
- Fix implemented and tested
- Documentation updated as needed
- Resolution verified by reporter when possible

### 5. Closure
- Defect marked as resolved in tracking system
- Lessons learned documented
- Process improvements identified

## Severity Levels

### Critical P1
- Training program cannot proceed
- Major functionality broken
- Security vulnerabilities
- **Response Time**: Immediate within 2 hours (24/7 coverage)
- **First Responder**: On-call engineer or repository maintainer
- **Escalation**: Immediate notification to project lead

### High P2
- Significant impact on training effectiveness
- Important features not working
- Workaround available but difficult
- **Response Time**: Same day within 8 hours (business hours: 9 AM - 6 PM EST)
- **First Responder**: Assigned team lead
- **Escalation**: Project lead notification within 4 hours if unresolved

### Medium P3
- Moderate impact on user experience
- Minor functionality issues
- Easy workaround available
- **Response Time**: Within 2 business days
- **First Responder**: Team member with relevant expertise
- **Escalation**: Weekly review if unresolved

### Low P4
- Cosmetic issues
- Enhancement requests
- Documentation improvements
- **Response Time**: Within 1 week
- **First Responder**: Any available team member
- **Escalation**: Monthly review for prioritization

## GitHub Labels Mapping

Our severity levels map to the following GitHub labels for consistent tracking:

- **P1 Critical** → `priority: critical`, `severity: high`
- **P2 High** → `priority: high`, `severity: medium`
- **P3 Medium** → `priority: medium`, `severity: low`
- **P4 Low** → `priority: low`, `enhancement`

## Tools and Scripts

### Automated Defect Management
- **[fix_defects.py](scripts/fix_defects.py)** - Automated defect resolution
- **[update_defect_log.py](scripts/update_defect_log.py)** - Defect log maintenance
- **[fix_workflows.py](scripts/fix_workflows.py)** - Workflow issue resolution

### Testing and Validation
- **[Test Suite](env/tests/)** - Comprehensive testing framework
- **[Environment Validation](scripts/validate_environment.sh)** - Setup verification

## Reporting Guidelines

### For Users
1. Check existing issues before creating new ones
2. Use appropriate issue templates:
   - [Bug Report](.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/bug_report.md)
   - [Training Question](.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/training_question.md)
3. Provide detailed reproduction steps
4. Include environment information
5. For security vulnerabilities, see [SECURITY.md](.github/SECURITY.md)

### For Contributors
1. Follow the pull request template
2. Include tests for bug fixes
3. Update documentation as needed
4. Reference related issues in commits

## Metrics and Monitoring

### Key Performance Indicators

**Mean Time to Resolution (MTTR)** by severity level:
- **Owner**: Engineering Manager
- **Review Cadence**: Weekly for P1/P2, Monthly for P3/P4

**Defect Escape Rate** - issues found in production:
- **Owner**: Quality Assurance Lead
- **Review Cadence**: Monthly assessment

**Customer Satisfaction** - user feedback on resolutions:
- **Owner**: Product Manager
- **Review Cadence**: Quarterly survey and analysis

**Defect Density** - defects per training module:
- **Owner**: Content Team Lead
- **Review Cadence**: After each major content update

### Reporting Schedule
- **Weekly Reviews**: P1/P2 defects, MTTR analysis
- **Monthly Reviews**: All severity levels, escape rate assessment
- **Quarterly Reviews**: Customer satisfaction, process improvements

### Process Improvement
- Regular retrospectives led by Project Manager
- Root cause analysis for critical defects
- Process refinement based on lessons learned
- Tool and automation improvements
